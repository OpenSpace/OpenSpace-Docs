# Point Data

Point datasets are data files containing a set of 3D positions. These can be used to spatially represent a vast variety of object types, where each object is represented by a point in space.

This section includes information pages that are relevant to the loading of point datasets in OpenSpace, including details about how to load and customize the datasets, add labels and how the relevant data file formats look like.
