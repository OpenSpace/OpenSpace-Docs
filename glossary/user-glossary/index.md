Renderable
    A renderable is the machinery that generates an object in OpenSpace. It is code that tells your compter how to represent data or an object within OpenSpace. Different data types have different renderables: stars are generated using the RenderableStars. RenderableLabel tells OpenSpace how to draw labels in the scene. For a list or renderables, see [](/reference/renderable-overview)
