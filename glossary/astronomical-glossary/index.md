Finger of god
    A "finger of god" is a line of galaxies that point radially back to the Milky Way. Early in the process of mapping the local universe, astronomers noticed that galaxies, when plotted, appeared on lines that pointed radially back to Earth. They saw these "lines" of galaxies pointing at Earth from all directions in the sky. It turns out we see fingers of god mostly in clusters of galaxies. 
    
    Within a cluster of galaxies, there are random motions as the galaxies all orbit the center of the cluster. We derive the distance to galaxies using their relative velocity, and, in a sense, the velocities inside a cluster are contaminated by these random, local motions (as opposed to the more global recessional velocity of the expanding universe). This results in a radial spread in distance for the galaxies in a cluster. And, all these radial "lines" all point back to the observer here on Earth, puzzling astronomers who first observed this in the earliest maps of the universe.
