# Sonification
The [Telemetry Module](index.md) can be used together with [SuperCollider](#supercollider) to create a sonification. Sonification is the concept of conveying information using sound (in contrast to visualization, where information is conveyed using visuals). In addition to the telemetry module in OpenSpace, the sonification requires a separate program, for example [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/). Any software can act as the receiver for the OSC messages from the telemetry module and uses that information to generate sounds, creating a sonification.

<!-- @TODO (malej) Add more sonifications to this list if we add more -->
OpenSpace currently provides three sonifications. The first is the [Planets Sonification](#planets-sonification-details), which is a complete sonification of the planets in the solar system. Then there is the [Customized Nodes Sonification](#customized-nodes-sonification), which is a smaller example sonification using the [Customized Nodes Information](./telemetry-types-general.md#customized-nodes-information) telemetry type. Lastly, there is the [OSC Example Sonification](#osc-example-sonification), which does not produce any sounds but instead contains more details on each telemetry type and basic examples of how to receive the OSC messages in SuperCollider.

:::{note}
Only one sonification can be listened to at a time in SuperCollider. Users need to keep in mind to disable the currently active sonification before enabling another one to listen to.

## SuperCollider
[SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) is the software used to produce the sounds of the sonifications. The messages from the telemetry module are sent to SuperCollider, which then uses that information to create sounds that correspond to that information.
To run a sonification file in SuperCollider, follow the following steps:
  1. Download and install [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) (if not already installed)
  1. Click any line within the outer parentheses `()` in the file and press <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>ENTER</kbd>. For example, line X in the [_planetsSonification.scd_](#planets-sonification-details) file or line 51 in the [_OpenSpace-OSC-example.scd_](#osc-example-sonification) file.
  1. Wait a while for SuperCollider to boot up its audio servers
  1. When you want to stop the sonification in SuperCollider, press <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>.</kbd> and go back to the first step to start it up again

:::{danger}
Due to an unresolved issue with the scene not being safe for multiple threads, especially during startup, the telemetry module cannot be enabled before OpenSpace has fully initialized. This means that it must be manually enabled each time OpenSpace is started. This is done through the checkbox for the module in the settings menu of the user interface.

<!-- @TODO (malej) Add instructions on how to switch the output audio device in SuperCollider -->

### Ambisonics
<!-- @TODO (malej) Add instructions on how to include the necessary SuperCollider dependencies to run the sonification in an immersive surround environment using ambisonics -->

## Planets Sonification Details
OpenSpace provides a sonification of the planets in the solar system. The files for this can be found in the folder _data\assets\modules\telemetry\sonification_ within the OpenSpace directory. The file _planets.asset_ is a regular OpenSpace asset that configures the [Planets Sonification](./telemetry-types-specialized.md#planets-sonification) in the telemetry module to monitor each of the planets in the solar system and their major moons. The sonification file itself is the _planetsSonification.scd_ file, which is a SuperCollider file and needs to be run separately in that program. The sonification will then be produced by SuperCollider using the information received from OpenSpace with the OSC messages from the telemetry module.

:::{important}
The _planets.asset_ file cannot be customized or altered since the sonification expects the data from the telemetry module to be in a certain format determined by this file. If this file is altered, then the sonification file needs to be updated to reflect the change as well. If you want to create your own sonification for objects in OpenSpace other than the planets, then the general [Customized Nodes Information](./telemetry-types-general.md#customized-nodes-information) telemetry type is likely a better fit for that purpose.

<!-- @TODO (malej) Add a video demonstrating the sonification -->

The telemetry module contains several telemetry types that send different information to the OSC receiver. The planets' sonification only uses some of the available telemetry types, namely:
  - [Planets Sonification](./telemetry-types-specialized.md#planets-sonification)
  - [Planets Compare Sonification](./telemetry-types-specialized.md#planets-compare-sonification)
  - [Planets Overview Sonification](./telemetry-types-specialized.md#planets-overview-sonification)
  - [Focus](./telemetry-types-general.md#focus)
  - [Time Information](./telemetry-types-general.md#time-information)
  - [Angle Calculation Mode](./telemetry-types-general.md#angle-calculation-mode)

<!-- @TODO (malej) Use the actual line number-->
The steps below explain how to run the planet sonification provided by OpenSpace:
  1. Download and install [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) (if not already installed)
  1. Run the sonification file _planetsSonification.scd_ located in _data\assets\modules\telemetry\sonification_ in SuperCollider
      - To run the file in SuperCollider, click on line X and press <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>ENTER</kbd>
      - Wait for the sonification to boot up
      - The SuperCollider console should display: `Sonification is ready` when it finishes booting
  1. Run OpenSpace with the profile called _sonification_
  1. Turn on the Telemetry module in the user interface under _Settings/Modules_
  1. Turn on the telemetry types that are of interest with the checkboxes in the telemetry module settings (refer to the list above)
  1. Fly around in OpenSpace and enjoy the sonification. When flying close to a planet when its sonification is enabled in the Planets Sonification, you should be able to hear it.

### The Sounds of the Planets Sonification
The table below briefly describes what aspects of the planets are conveyed by the sonification, how they sound, and how the sounds change depending on the data.
:::{table}
:align: center
| Planet Property      | Sonification Sound        | Mapping Polarity                                            |
|----------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mass                 | Pitch                     | Higher pitch = Lower mass                                   |
| Length of Day        | Tempo of oscillation      | Faster tempo = Shorter day                                  |
| Length of Year       | Surround position         | Uses [angle calculations](./angle-information.md) to place the planet in a surround sound configuration |
| Gravity              | Bouncing ball sound       | Faster bouncing ball = Stronger gravity                     |
| Temperature          | Sizzling intensity        | More sizzling = Higher temperature                          |
| Atmospheric Pressure | Depth of wind sound       | Deeper wind sound = Higher atmospheric pressure             |
| Average Wind Speed   | Fluctuation of wind sound | More fluctuations in wind sound = Faster average wind speed |

:::{note}
The planets sonification uses additional planetary data that is specified in the _planetsSonification.scd_ file and does not solely depend on the data from OpenSpace. This data comes from the [Nasa Planetary Fact Sheet](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/) and does not change.

## Customized Nodes Sonification
This sonification is a smaller example using the [Customized Nodes Information](./telemetry-types-general.md#customized-nodes-information) telemetry type. It uses the file _nodesSonification.scd_, which can be found in the folder _data\assets\modules\telemetry\sonification_ within the OpenSpace directory. This sonification follows the two space stations ISS and Tiangong in OpenSpace.

The steps below explain how to run the customized nodes sonification provided by OpenSpace:
  1. Download and install [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) (if not already installed)
  1. Run the sonification file _nodesSonification.scd_ located in _data\assets\modules\telemetry\sonification_ in SuperCollider
      - To run the file in SuperCollider, click on line X and press <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>ENTER</kbd>
      - Wait a while for the sonification to boot up
      - The SuperCollider console should respond with: `Sonification is ready` when it is finished booting
  1. Run OpenSpace with any profile
  1. Load the asset file _nodes.asset_ either by dragging and dropping the file into OpenSpace, or by creating a new profile that loads that asset
  1. Turn on the Telemetry module in the user interface under _Settings/Modules_
  1. Turn on the Customized Nodes Information telemetry type with the checkbox in the telemetry module settings
  1. Fly around in OpenSpace and enjoy the sonification. When flying close to ISS or Tiangong when its sonification is enabled in the Planets Sonification, you should be able to hear the sonification.

## OSC Example Sonification
This is an example sonification that does not produce any sounds but instead provides additional documentation for each telemetry type and provides basic examples of how the OSC messages can be received from OpenSpace. It uses the file _OpenSpace-OSC-example.scd_, which can be found in the folder _data\assets\examples\sonification_ within the OpenSpace directory.

The steps below explain how to run the OSC example sonification provided by OpenSpace:
  1. Download and install [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) (if not already installed)
  1. Run the sonification file _OpenSpace-OSC-example.scd_ located in _data\assets\examples\sonification_ in SuperCollider
      - To run the file in SuperCollider, click on line 51 and press <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>ENTER</kbd>
      - Wait a while for the sonification to boot up
      - The SuperCollider console should respond with: `-> OSCdef(Neptune, /Neptune, nil, nil, nil)` when it is finished booting
  1. Run OpenSpace with the profile called _sonification_
  1. Load the asset file _nodes.asset_ either by dragging and dropping the file into OpenSpace, or by creating a new profile (based on the sonification profile) that loads that asset
  1. Turn on the Telemetry module in the user interface under _Settings/Modules_
  1. Turn on all telemetry types with the checkboxes in the telemetry module settings
  1. Fly around in OpenSpace, and you should see messages being printed in the SuperCollider console window

## Surround Sound Configurations
The surround sound aspect of the provided sonifications is designed for two specific configurations, as shown in the images below. In both images, black dots represent speakers, and the subwoofer is positioned outside the circle because it is not considered a directional sound source.

The image above shows a **top-down** view of the surround sound setup for the Visualization Center Dome Theater in NorrkÃ¶ping, Sweden. The audience sits in rows inside the circle, facing the front center of the dome surface, which is marked as _Center_ at the top of the image. The arrow in the image represents the viewing direction of the audience. The circle represents the edge of the dome surface. This configuration uses the [Horizontal](./angle-information.md#horizontal) angle calculation mode without the elevation angle, as it only has one ring of speakers.

The image above shows a **bottom-up** view of the surround sound setup for the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, USA. The audience sits in concentric rings inside the outermost circle, looking up toward the center of the dome surface, which is marked as _Center_ with a blue cross in the middle of the image. For a better understanding of the 3D structure, see the image below that shows the dome in 3D from a side view. In the image below, the arrow represents the viewing direction of the audience. The outermost ring represents the edge of the dome surface. This configuration uses the [Circular](./angle-information.md#circular) angle calculation mode with the elevation angle enabled, as it has multiple rings of speakers.

### Further Notes
Even though the sonifications have been designed with these specific surround configurations in mind, it is still possible to use them in other surround configurations. When choosing the appropriate [Angle Calculation Mode](./angle-information.md) for your surround sound configuration, consider two factors: whether there is a clear forward direction and the number of rings or rows of speakers. Use [Horizontal](./angle-information.md#horizontal) mode if there is a clear forward direction, and [Circular](./angle-information.md#circular) mode otherwise. If there is only one ring or row of speakers, then the elevation information can be omitted. Otherwise, the multiple rings or rows of speakers can be used to convey elevation information, and the elevation angle can be included in the angle calculations.
