# Contribute


## Get involved
OpenSpace is an open-source project and relies on the contribution by a community of volunteers. In particular, the documentation always needs feedback and help. If you come across errors in the documentation, find something that is unclear, or lack essential information, help us to make the documentation better by either letting us know in the `#documentation` channel of the [Slack channel](https://openspacesupport.slack.com) or by suggesting a change on the [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenSpace/OpenSpace-Docs) of the documentation.



 Information that is predominantly aimed at developers that want to contribute to the C++ source code of OpenSpace and/or compile the software from source found on [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenSpace/OpenSpace).
