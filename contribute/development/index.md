# Development

This site includes pages with information about different aspects of contributing to the development of OpenSpace or related services.

If this is your first time contributing to the software, a useful starting point may be the pages about [compiling the software](./compiling/index).

To get an understanding of the structure of software code, please check out the [Code Structure](./structure/index) and [Folder Layout](./folder-layout) pages.
