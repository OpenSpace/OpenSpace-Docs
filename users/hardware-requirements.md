# Hardware requirements
OpenSpace is designed for use on a wide array of devices ranging from laptops to state-of-the-art planetarium domes. Additionally, it is possible to create arbitrary complex scenes, which makes providing accurate hardware requirements challenging.

However, a minimum i5 processor and Nvidia 1060 GTX GPU (or comparable), 8 GB RAM, and 4 GB VRAM are suggested. For optimal use, we recommend 16 GB RAM and 6 GB VRAM or more. The default profile also requires an internet connection - broadband (25 Mbps or higher) is recommended.
