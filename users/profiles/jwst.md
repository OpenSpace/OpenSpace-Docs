# James Webb Space Telescope
This profile visualizes the NASA-ESA-CAN James Webb Space Telescope, which launched on December 25, 2021. The profile includes two visualizations of the Webb trail: One plotted with respect to the Earth-Sun L2, where it will be stationed; and another with respect to the Sun, as we plot the orbits of the planets. The profile includes a dynamic model of Webb and a time lapse of its deployment and unfolding. The profile includes the capability to point the telescope with an associated view frustum to any celestial coordinates. The orientation can be controlled by entering Right Ascension (R.A.) and Declination (Dec.) on an [external webpage](http://ui.openspaceproject.com/jwst_scripts).
