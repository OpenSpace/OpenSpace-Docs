# Touch
This profile provides five demonstration experiences for a Windows touch table: Explore the galaxies, explore the solar system, explore Jupiter and its moons, explore weather events on Earth, and explore interesting sites on Mars. These experiences were created by students as examples. OpenSpace users can create their own experiences with the content they would like to show.
