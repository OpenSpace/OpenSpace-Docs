# Default (Grand Tour)
% This profile is enabled on default and provides the ability to look at detailed terrain models of the Earth, Moon, Mars, other planets, and the Digital Universe extrasolar catalog.

% The view defaults on Earth at the current time with the ESRI VIIRS Combo enabled. This uses the Suomi VIIRS daily images when viewing the whole Earth, and switches to high-detail imagery from ESRI when zooming in.



The default profile loads the basic data sets that enable a broad tour of the universe. It loads the base asset file, which includes an array of data from Earth out to the most distant objects we can see, along with many default keyboard shortcuts, and some actions as well.

## Tour


::::::{grid} 1 2 2 2

:::::{grid-item}
We always begin our exploration of the universe with what's most familiar---Earth, our home. This tour will give you a sense of what's out there, and where we are in the observable universe.

In this tour, we will explore the Universe from Earth to the most distant objects we see. Obviously, we will gloss over many details---these tours are designed from our hour-long talks we give to audiences.

Earth is, of course, home to everyone you know, and we're all huddled on those parts of the planet that are above present sea level---about 30% of the planet's surface. Earth remains a dynamic planet, with plate tectonics, active volcanoes, and crust formation.

Earth formed about 4.6 billion years ago, but our modern species appeared only about 200,000 years ago. In that time, we have populated all corners of the planet, developed agriculture circa 10,000 years ago, and produce enough food to be able to think beyond our own survival and about things that enrich our lives and advance civilization.

The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. Its average distance is 384,400 km (almost 239,000 miles), but it ranges from 362,000 km at its nearest to 405,000 km at its most distant (that's 225,000 miles to 251,600 miles).

The Moon is the farthest humans have ventured into space. In fact, the record for the farthest humans from Earth belongs to the crew of Apollo 13, the failed mission to the Moon. On April 15, 1970, their flightpath took them 254 km (158 miles) above the far side of the Moon, or 400,171 km (248,655 miles) from Earth. We have sent probes farther into space, but we have not set foot on any other world beyond the Moon. We last left the Moon on December 14, 1972, over fifty years ago.
:::::

:::::{admonition} Light Travel Time
We can also express distance in terms of light travel time. You may be familiar with the term {term}`light year`, which is the _distance_ over which light travels in one year. The Moon is so close, we need to talk about the light travel time in light seconds. Its average distance is equal to about 1.3 light seconds, so it takes 1.3 seconds for light to travel from Earth to the Moon. When the astronauts were walking on the Moon, it took 1.3 seconds for Houston to relay a message to them, and another 1.3 seconds for their response to reach Houston.

The Sun, our host star, is, on average, 150 million km (93 million miles) from Earth, which we can also state as 8 light minutes---it takes 8 minutes for the Sun's light to reach your eyes on Earth. When you look at the Sun (which you should never do directly), you're seeing it as it was 8 minutes ago. In this way, we're looking back in time as we look out into the universe.

In contrast to these planets, Pluto is inclined 17&deg; to this plane, clearly demonstrating it's different from the planets. When viewed from above the plane, you can see that the trajectory of Pluto is interior to Neptune's orbit for a portion of its 248-year journey around the Sun.

Once we discovered Kuiper Belt objects in 1992---small, rock-ice worlds beyond Neptune---astronomers understood that Pluto resembles these objects, and belongs with its Kuiper Belt brethren. Pluto is now one of a many [dwarf planets](/content/solar-system/dwarf-planets/index) in the Solar System, and one of over 2,000 known objects orbiting in the Kuiper Belt.

:::::{admonition} Composition of the Solar System
The Solar System is composed of an exotic variety of objects that orbit the Sun. The Sun, a rather average star, contains the vast majority of the mass of the Solar System (99.85%). Jupiter, the largest planet, is 317 times the mass of Earth, but all the planets account for only 0.135% of the Solar System's mass. The remaining 0.015% is made up of asteroids, dwarf planets, meteoroids, and smaller objects.

Even from this great distance, with the constellation lines on, we still see the same star patterns traced in the starry sky. The familiar Ursa Major ("Big Dipper"), Orion, Scorpius, and the other constellations remain the same from this perspective because the stars are very far away. We also see the band of light we call the Milky Way.

The constellation lines connect stars that trace the figures outlined in the night sky. The sky is divided into eighty-eight constellations, each claiming a region of the sky as a country's borders claim part
of a continent.

Some of the nearby stars are easily distinguished. In particular, Sirius, the brightest star in the sky (due to its intrinsic brightness and its distance), is about 9 light years from the Sun. Nearby is Procyon, about 11.5 light years from us. Opposite the Sun is Vega, 25 light years away, and Altair, around 16 light years from Earth. Several dimmer stars also populate the solar neighborhood.

Stars come in a variety of masses, which determine their temperatures, colors, and luminosities. Bluer stars are more massive and hotter. These stars have short lifetimes and there are far fewer of them in the Galaxy. Redder stars, on the other hand, are less massive and cooler, and are abundant throughout the Milky Way. The Sun is generally average in terms of brightness and will remain a star for another five billion years.

It may appear we are now lost in a sea of stars and constellation lines connecting some of them, but we can now explore objects on larger scales beyond the solar neighborhood.

Each exoplanet marker indicates a star with a confirmed planetary system. None of these were known before 1995, so this is a relatively new branch of astrophysics, and a burgeoning one at that. We now know of over 5,000 planets outside our Solar System, and some of these systems have multiple planets, indicated by the parenthetical number in their label (no number signifies only one known planet).

:::::{grid-item}
From this vantage point, turn on the Radio Sphere. The Radio Sphere is a hypothetical boundary that traces the extent of Earth's radio signals.

Earth began broadcasting to the universe around 1940. Before that, signals did not escape the atmosphere. But, in 1940, stronger signals were able to pass through the atmosphere and travel into space at one light year per year---as all light does. This results in an ever-expanding bubble we call the Radio Sphere.

At the boundary, roughly 80 light years away, are Earth's oldest
signals, like the initial broadcast of [_I Love Lucy_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Love_Lucy). As we look closer to Earth, we see more recent signals, until we arrive at Earth, where today's signals are being emitted.

We mentioned earlier that this is a hypothetical boundary because these signals lose strength as they travel out into space---as all light does. The intensity of light falls off as the radius increases---the farther you are from a candle, the dimmer it appears---and Earth's signals are no different.

In reality, by the time our radio signals reach the outer Solar System, their strength is equal to that of the cosmic noise, the background signals that randomly float throughout the Galaxy. The radio sphere remains a hypothetical boundary, but exemplifies our farthest reach into the universe, not by humans or machines, but by light we produced on Earth.

While the exoplanet systems seemed evenly distributed around the Sun when we were closer to it, now we see some peculiarities. You see a cone of exoplanet systems extending away from the Sun (above the Sun in this image). This is the Kepler Mission's field of view, which we'll discuss next. 

Imagine how many planets we'd see today if Kepler was able to look at the entire sky...

:::::{grid-item}
Initially, we observed large planets in nearby stars---all the known planets were relatively close to the Sun. In 2009, the Kepler Telescope was launched into space. Its mission was to stare at one patch of sky near the constellation Cygnus, and find planets in that patch of sky using one [detection method](/content/milky-way/exoplanets/index). Later, in 2018, TESS was launched and is scanning the entire sky for planets.

The Exoplanet Candidates are stars, colored by mission, that are thought to be strong candidates for hosting planets. Yellow stars are from the Kepler Mission, orange stars are from the K2 Mission, and green stars are from TESS. We see the Kepler footprint clearly in the Exoplanet data---it used to be more prominent but many former candidates are now confirmed exoplanet systems and appear in that data set instead.

The Galaxy is composed of over 100 billion stars, gas, and {term}`dust <astrophysical dust>`. This gas and dust is arranged in spiral arms that emanate from center of the Galaxy and are confined to a thin disk. Its bright center is rife with stars and a supermassive black hole. The black hole is considered inactive, with a low rate of accretion.

The Galaxy is about 100,000 light years across, but the disk is only about 1,000 light years thick in the spiral arms. Galaxies, generally, are star-making machines, where stars are born from this gas and provide light in the otherwise dark universe. When stars die, they return some fraction of their gas back into the Galaxy to form a new star one day. The Sun formed about five billion years ago from such a cloud, and has about five billion years left before it evolves into a [white dwarf](/content/milky-way/stellar-remnants/white-dwarfs/index)---an Earth-sized, dim object that will ultimately fade away.

% Stars form in the disk of the Milky Way---the part we see now---but, the Galaxy has a spherical component called the halo. The spherical halo stretches beyond the disk and is filled with cool, dim stars. Cooler stars have much longer lifetimes (they burn their fuel more slowly), and live long enough to be sent on a trajectory out of the disk of the Galaxy, where they formed. Over time, the halo has been populated with such stars.

All of the stars we see in the night sky with our eye (about 9,000 total---6,000 over the course of one night) are very close to the Sun. We cannot see stars this far away from the Sun without sophisticated telescopes.

Given that the Milky Way has hundreds of billions of stars, it's compelling to wonder just how many planets might be in our own Galaxy. Not all stars will necessarily have planets, but astronomers estimate that the number could be over 500 billion planets.

Everything moves in and around the Galaxy. We can see the trajectory of the Sun over the next billion years by turning on the Sun's orbit. The Sun, and its accompanying planets, orbit about the center of the Milky Way about once every 225 million years. This makes us about 20 galactic years old, in other words, we've made about 20 revolutions around the Galaxy since the Sun was born.

On this scale, life began on Earth about 17 galactic years ago, multicellular life appeared about 7 galactic years ago, the KT extinction event occurred 0.3 galactic years ago (65 million years ago), and modern humans appeared 0.001 galactic years ago (roughly 200,000 years ago).

The Sun has only moved about 145 light years in the time since humans have walked on Earth, a tiny fraction of its galactic orbit and a distance that could fit inside the [Radio Sphere](/content/milky-way/graphics/radio-sphere/index).

The Sun's orbit is remarkably stable, in contrast to other stars that orbit the Galaxy in irregular, unstable orbits, inside and outside the Galactic disk. Turn on some of the other star orbits to see just how unstable they are.

The Milky Way is surrounded by many smaller objects called dwarf galaxies. Dwarf galaxies are small systems with up to several billion stars. They often orbit and interact with larger galaxies, which play a part in their evolution. The Milky Way has many such dwarfs in its sphere of influence. These include the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC, if you have the labels on), and many other small star systems, a few of which are colliding with the Milky Way right now.

The Milky Way dominates this area, but nearby is the Andromeda galaxy, another large spiral galaxy about 2.5 million light years away. It is slightly larger than the Milky Way, and also has a number of dwarf galaxies caught in its gravitational pull. These two large spiral galaxies, along with another called Triangulum (or, Messier 33), and the many dwarf galaxies, comprise what's called the Local Group.

All of these galaxies are influencing one another gravitationally. In fact, the Milky Way (center of the aqua points) and Andromeda (center of the yellow points) are on a collision course toward one another. In about four billion years (22 galactic years from now), the two mammoth galaxies will begin their dance, ramming directly into one another.

Eventually, these two galaxies will coalesce into one large system, in about 30 galactic years from now---long after Earth becomes inhospitable and the Sun is extinguished.

Far off in the future, circa 150 billion years from now, all the galaxies of the Local Group will have coalesced into one large galaxy, but that's a topic for another tour.

As we pull away from the Local Group, we begin to see the local
universe is populated with many galaxies. These galaxies are in the
Tully Catalog, compiled by Brent Tully. It is one of the earliest
three-dimensional catalogs of the nearby universe, and its roughly
30,000 galaxies remain one of the richest galaxy atlases, with
properly scaled and inclined images. Turn on the Galaxy Groups
labels to see most of the nearby galaxy groups.

A little farther out and we can see the galaxy clusters in orange. The
Virgo Cluster is the nearest, large cluster to us. It’s over 50 million
light years away, and contains over 1,000 galaxies. This is the bustling
center in our corner of the universe.

With the boundaries off, we now see the nearby galaxies more
clearly. As you orbit more quickly, the weblike structure of the local
universe becomes more apparent. We see clusters of galaxies connected
by strands and filaments of galaxies. Between them, we see
relatively empty areas, called Voids.

% The Virgo Cluster is the heart of the Virgo Supercluster. A supercluster is a conglomeration of galaxy clusters and groupings. They are among the largest structures known. But, their constituent clusters and galaxies are not necessarily bound gravitationally, their motions are guided more by the overall expansion of the universe. With the Virgo Supercluster Boundary on, you can see the Local Group is only a tiny part of the supercluster, and located far from its center.

% In 2014, Brent Tully and a group of astronomers discovered that we are part of an even larger structure which they named the Laniakea Supercluster. This humongous region contains the Milky Way and many thousands of galaxies. The Virgo Supercluster is now just one region among a larger complex of galaxy clusters, connecting strands, and filaments. -->

None of these other groups are as rich as the Local Group because
we cannot see tiny dwarf galaxies from such great distances. From
out here, we would likely only see Andromeda, Milky Way, and
Triangulum—the large, luminous galaxies. Many of the Messier❉
galaxies are somewhat local, like M81, M101, M51. One can imagine
a cadre of small dwarf galaxies around each of these groups.

Once you’re outside the 30,000 galaxies in Tully, you’ll notice that
it forms a cube. The universe, of course, is not cube shaped. This
squared-off boundary ensures that these data remain consistent. In
other words, including galaxies beyond this area would selectively
include the brighter galaxies, but not the dim ones represented in
the data you see. These data would no longer be representative of
the structure of the universe.

You may also notice a cleft in the middle of the dataset. This is what
we call the zone of obscuration❉. It delineates an absence of galaxies,
but it is an observational phenomenon. We cannot see the galaxies
that exist in these areas because that band of light in the night
sky—the Milky Way—blocks our view of the galaxies beyond.

he Tully Catalog is special because it’s an all-sky survey—galaxies
were observed in all directions. As we look to more distant objects,
it becomes more difficult to achieve this because it takes far more
time to peer deeper into the universe.

Galaxy surveys farther out from Tully cover only part of the sky. If
one viewed them from Earth, they form distinct patches on the sky,
but in three dimensions, they fill out a conical shape, and galaxies
lie across a range of distances for each line of sight.

The Two-Degree Field Survey (2dF) is an excellent example. The
project was designed to observe along two strips of sky that are
opposite one another, but in three dimensions they are narrow fins,
shaped like a bow tie, if you will. We benefit, visually, from their
narrowness because we can see the rich structure within these fins.
Density scales with color. Orange galaxies are in more dense regions,
green galaxies are in more sparse areas of the cosmos, while
aqua galaxies are in the middle, density wise.

The 2dF’s 229,000 galaxies show the same sponge-like structure,
with clusters, filaments, and voids. We also see larger-scale structures
like sheets and so-called walls of galaxies.

Peering even deeper, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey covers more of
the sky. It contains over 2.5 million galaxies, and also echoes the
large-scale structure we observe in other surveys.

With these surveys, it’s important not to lose sight of the fact that
each point you see is a large galaxy akin to the Milky Way. Each
point has billions of stars, and who knows how many planets.

These deep surveys demonstrate that we are only one small planet,
orbiting an ordinary star, in an unremarkable galaxy, in a nondescript
part of the universe.







Beyond the galaxy surveys are quasars—the farthest objects we see.
Quasar is just another name for an active galaxy. An active galaxy is
one where the central black hole is gobbling up material at a rapid
rate. This process causes immense amounts of energy to be released
just outside the black hole, as the material falls into it, making these
objects extremely luminous. The Milky Way is no longer this active,
in this sense, so astronomers call it a normal galaxy.

Upon initial observation, these mystery objects were called quasi-
stellar objects, and the shortened name, quasar, stuck. But, really
we’re mapping active galactic nuclei, or, in another sense, you can
think of this as a catalog of supermassive black holes.

This catalog consists of a half million quasars, and you can see they
extend to far greater distances than the galaxies. However, we are
now only seeing the brightest objects, so no discernible structure
is apparent. There are radial artifacts where more quasars lie, but
these are not real, they result from how the data were observed.
You may also notice that there are no quasars near the Milky Way.
We only see so-called normal galaxies around us, like our own.
Why is this?

As we look deeper into the universe, we are looking back in cosmic
time. When we see the 2.5-million-light-year-distant Andromeda
galaxy with our eyes❉ or a telescope, we’re seeing it as was 2.5
million years ago. When we see one of these quasars, we’re seeing
light that left billions of years ago. So, we’re looking at an earlier
epoch in the universe. It’s likely that these quasars have evolved
into normal galaxies by now, but the light has not had enough
time to reach our eyes. So, all the quasars that once dominated our
neighborhood have now evolved into normal galaxies, and their
light has had enough time to reach our eyes on Earth.

Quasars are the farthest objects we see in the universe, and represent
some of the brightest objects we see. The farthest object ever
seen is a quasar whose light began its journey when the universe
was less than a billion years old. Peak activity for quasars was
around 10 billion years ago, when the universe was about 4 billion
years old.

### Cosmic Perspective

Quasars may be the most distant objects we see, but there is light
from an earlier epoch of the universe that remains visible to us.
The so-called baby picture of the universe is the cosmic microwave
background (CMB). It is light we observe in microwave wavelengths,
and marks an important transition in the young universe.

The Planck map. The Planck mission delivered the most recent
survey of the CMB in 2013. It is a map of temperature variation in
microwave light. The differences between the orange and blue areas
is 1/100,000 of a degree, so the telescope that detects these differences
is very precise. This light marks the beginning of the radiation
epoch in the universe—when light began to travel freely across the
universe.

The Big Bang occurred 13.8 billion years ago. The early universe
expanded rapidly and was a sea of protons and free electrons. Any
light in the early universe was constantly scattered off these particles,
just as light is scattered off water vapor on a foggy day, preventing
us from seeing objects in the distance.

The fog lifted. Around 400,000 years after the Big Bang, the universe
expanded and cooled enough to allow these free electrons to
combine with the protons and form hydrogen. When this occurred,
it was as if the fog lifted, and light was able to freely travel across
the universe.

The CMB is an imprint of the universe at this time. These slight
differences in temperature reflect the tiny fluctuations in density in
the early universe—the structure of the universe shortly after the
Big Bang. These are the seeds that will eventually grow, by gravity,
into the large-scale structure of galaxy clusters and filaments we see
today. How we went from these small fluctuations in this map to
present-day structure remains one of the great challenges in astrophysics
today.

When recombination took place, the light from the Big Bang peaked
at about 1 micrometer, which is in the infrared. At that time
the gas would have been about 3,000 Kelvin (about 2,700 °C or
5,000 °F) and would have glowed orange-red in the visible spectrum.
However, the universe has expanded 1,000 times since, and
the light within space has been shifted to longer and longer wavelengths
because of that expansion. Today, the peak wavelength is
close to 1 mm (1 micrometer × 1,000 = 1 mm) and corresponds to
a gas temperature around 3 Kelvin (3,000 K ÷ 1,000 = 3 K), which
is in the microwave spectrum (about –270 °C or –454 °F).

Placement. We place the CMB on a sphere that signifies the
boundary of our observable universe. This is a bit misleading. While
this is the earliest light we can see, it is ubiquitous throughout the
universe, even in the Solar System.

And, what does it mean to fly outside the observable universe? It
is not physically relevant, but represents, at best, a thought experiment.
We prefer to stay within the bounds of what we see.







We’ve now covered the observable universe. Does that cover the
entire universe? No. In a way, this defines the bubble that we can
see. We can imagine if we lived on one of these far-off quasars, our
bubble would be centered on that quasar.

We are not the center. These surveys might tempt us to think
we’re at the center of everything. This is merely an artifact of our
perspective—everything you see in this atlas is observed data seen
from our vantage point. And, every point in the universe has its own
unique vantage point.

There is no center. In fact, the universe has no center. The best
analogy to describe the fabric of spacetime that comprises the universe
is to imagine inflating a balloon. As the balloon grows larger,
the distance between any two points on its surface increases. And,
more importantly, everything in the universe exists on the surface of
the balloon. To go from point A to point B, one cannot go through
the center of the balloon, one must travel along the surface of the
balloon. The universe behaves in a similar manner, albeit with far
greater complexity.

As we return to Earth, we traverse the scales of the universe, from
a view that encompass billions of light years, down to objects in
the Milky Way that are tens to hundreds of light years in size, to the
kilometer-scale continents on earth. Our ability to bridge all these
scales allows us to see these data in one, consistent scene, all within
the context of the scales that surround it.

Upon returning to Earth, it’s easy to see just how small we are and
how insignificant Earth is, even in our own galaxy, let alone the rest
of the universe. But, it also reveals the staggering probability that
life (in some form or fashion) exists somewhere, in another far-off
galaxy, or even within the Milky Way. The possibility is just too
great to assume that life exists only on Earth.

Conclusion. That’s the grand tour. Hopefully, you have an idea of
the scale of the observable universe, and what surrounds us in the
Solar System, the Milky Way galaxy, and outside the Galaxy. We
are a tiny spec among many other specs in the universe, and we’ve
come to understand so much about how the universe formed, our
place within it, and its ultimate fate. The universe never fails to invoke
a sense of wonder and, in its light, presents pieces to a puzzle
that we yearn to solve.
