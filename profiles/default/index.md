# Default (Grand Tour)
% This profile is enabled on default and provides the ability to look at detailed terrain models of the Earth, Moon, Mars, other planets, and the Digital Universe extrasolar catalog.

% The view defaults on Earth at the current time with the ESRI VIIRS Combo enabled. This uses the Suomi VIIRS daily images when viewing the whole Earth, and switches to high-detail imagery from ESRI when zooming in.



The default profile loads the basic data sets that enable a broad tour of the universe. It loads the base asset file, which includes an array of data from Earth out to the most distant objects we can see, along with many default keyboard shortcuts, and some actions as well.

## Tour


::::::{grid} 1 2 2 2

:::::{grid-item}
We always begin our exploration of the universe with what's most familiar---Earth, our home. This tour will give you a sense of what's out there, and where we are in the observable universe.

In this tour, we will explore the Universe from Earth to the most distant objects we see. Obviously, we will gloss over many details---these tours are designed from our hour-long talks we give to audiences.

### Earth & Moon


#### Earth
{octicon}`rocket;1.25em;profile-tour-action` Start a slow orbit around Earth.

:::::{grid-item}
Earth is, of course, home to everyone you know, and we're all huddled on those parts of the planet that are above present sea level---about 30% of the planet's surface. Earth remains a dynamic planet, with plate tectonics, active volcanoes, and crust formation.

Earth formed about 4.6 billion years ago, but our modern species appeared only about 200,000 years ago. In that time, we have populated all corners of the planet, developed agriculture circa 10,000 years ago, and produce enough food to be able to think beyond our own survival and about things that enrich our lives and advance civilization.

#### Distance of the Moon
{octicon}`rocket;1.25em;profile-tour-action` Pull away from Earth so that the Moon's orbit is in full view, and continue orbiting Earth.

::::::{grid} 1 2 2 2
:::::{grid-item}
[![Moon's orbit](moon_orbit.png)](moon_orbit.png)
:::::

:::::{grid-item}
The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. Its average distance is 384,400 km (almost 239,000 miles), but it ranges from 362,000 km at its nearest to 405,000 km at its most distant (that's 225,000 miles to 251,600 miles).

The Moon is the farthest humans have ventured into space. In fact, the record for the farthest humans from Earth belongs to the crew of Apollo 13, the failed mission to the Moon. On April 15, 1970, their flightpath took them 254 km (158 miles) above the far side of the Moon, or 400,171 km (248,655 miles) from Earth. We have sent probes farther into space, but we have not set foot on any other world beyond the Moon. We last left the Moon on December 14, 1972, over fifty years ago.

:::::{admonition} Light Travel Time
We can also express distance in terms of light travel time. You may be familiar with the term {term}`light year`, which is the _distance_ over which light travels in one year. The Moon is so close, we need to talk about the light travel time in light seconds. Its average distance is equal to about 1.3 light seconds, so it takes 1.3 seconds for light to travel from Earth to the Moon. When the astronauts were walking on the Moon, it took 1.3 seconds for Houston to relay a message to them, and another 1.3 seconds for their response to reach Houston.
:::::



#### Distance of the Sun

{octicon}`rocket;1.25em;profile-tour-action` Pull out from Earth to see the planets of the inner Solar System.

::::::{grid} 1 2 2 2
:::::{grid-item}
[![Inner planet orbits](sun_distance.png)](sun_distance.png)
:::::

:::::{grid-item}
The Sun, our host star, is, on average, 150 million km (93 million miles) from Earth, which we can also state as 8 light minutes---it takes 8 minutes for the Sun's light to reach your eyes on Earth. When you look at the Sun (which you should never do directly), you're seeing it as it was 8 minutes ago. In this way, we're looking back in time as we look out into the universe.

### Outer Solar System

#### The Planets

{octicon}`rocket;1.25em;profile-tour-action` Fly away from Earth so that the entire Solar System is in view,  continue orbiting.

::::::{grid} 1 2 2 2
:::::{grid-item}
[![Planet orbits](solar_system_planets.png)](solar_system_planets.png)
:::::

:::::{grid-item}
From outside the orbit of Neptune, we see the eight planets of the Solar System. The inner, rocky planets are huddled near the Sun. The outer, gaseous planets are far larger and each harbor a complex system of moons.


The planets align very well within a common plane. Mercury is inclined about 7&deg; to this plane, but the other seven planets are all within two degrees of the plane.

[![Pluto's orbit](pluto_orbit.png)](pluto_orbit.png)


:::::

:::::{grid-item}
In contrast to these planets, Pluto is inclined 17&deg; to this plane, clearly demonstrating it's different from the planets. When viewed from above the plane, you can see that the trajectory of Pluto is interior to Neptune's orbit for a portion of its 248-year journey around the Sun.

Once we discovered Kuiper Belt objects in 1992---small, rock-ice worlds beyond Neptune---astronomers understood that Pluto resembles these objects, and belongs with its Kuiper Belt brethren. Pluto is now one of a many [dwarf planets](/content/solar-system/dwarf-planets/index) in the Solar System, and one of over 2,000 known objects orbiting in the Kuiper Belt.

:::::{admonition} Composition of the Solar System
The Solar System is composed of an exotic variety of objects that orbit the Sun. The Sun, a rather average star, contains the vast majority of the mass of the Solar System (99.85%). Jupiter, the largest planet, is 317 times the mass of Earth, but all the planets account for only 0.135% of the Solar System's mass. The remaining 0.015% is made up of asteroids, dwarf planets, meteoroids, and smaller objects.

### Constellations & Stars

#### Constellation Lines

{octicon}`diff-added;1.25em;profile-tour-action` {menuselection}`Scene --> Milky Way --> Constellations --> Constellation Lines`

::::::{grid} 1 2 2 2
:::::{grid-item}
[![Solar System orbits plus the constellation lines](solar_system_constellations.png)](solar_system_constellations.png)
:::::

:::::{grid-item}
Even from this great distance, with the constellation lines on, we still see the same star patterns traced in the starry sky. The familiar Ursa Major ("Big Dipper"), Orion, Scorpius, and the other constellations remain the same from this perspective because the stars are very far away. We also see the band of light we call the Milky Way.

The constellation lines connect stars that trace the figures outlined in the night sky. The sky is divided into eighty-eight constellations, each claiming a region of the sky as a country's borders claim part
of a continent.

#### Nearby Stars

{octicon}`diff-added;1.25em;profile-tour-action` {menuselection}`Scene --> Solar System --> Sun --> Sun Label` \
{octicon}`rocket;1.25em;profile-tour-action` Fly away from Earth until you begin to see the nearby stars move.

As you fly away from the Sun and Earth, you will begin to see some of the nearby stars move. The constellation lines will become distorted as the two-dimensional sky transforms into three-dimensional space.

#### Star Names

{octicon}`diff-added;1.25em;profile-tour-action` {menuselection}`Scene --> Milky Way --> Stars --> Star Labels`

::::::{grid} 1 2 2 2
:::::{grid-item}
[![Star labels](star_names.png)](star_names.png)
:::::

:::::{grid-item}
Some of the nearby stars are easily distinguished. In particular, Sirius, the brightest star in the sky (due to its intrinsic brightness and its distance), is about 9 light years from the Sun. Nearby is Procyon, about 11.5 light years from us. Opposite the Sun is Vega, 25 light years away, and Altair, around 16 light years from Earth. Several dimmer stars also populate the solar neighborhood.

[![star colors](star_colors.png)](star_colors.png)
:::::

:::::{grid-item}
From this location, you may notice that the stars exhibit various brightnesses and colors, as they do in the night sky. Stars come in a variety of masses, which determine their temperatures, colors, and luminosities. Bluer stars are more massive and hotter. These stars have short lifetimes and there are far fewer of them in the Galaxy. Redder stars, on the other hand, are less massive and cooler, and are abundant throughout the Milky Way. The Sun is generally average in terms of brightness and will remain a star for another five billion years.

### Exoplanets

#### Exoplanet Systems

{octicon}`diff-added;1.25em;profile-tour-action` {menuselection}`Scene --> Milky Way --> Exoplanets --> Exoplanet Systems` \
{octicon}`rocket;1.25em;profile-tour-action` Continue flying away to examine the exoplanet data.


::::::{grid} 1 2 2 2
:::::{grid-item}
[![The exoplanetary systems with the constellation lines.](exoplanets_constellations.png)](exoplanets_constellations.png)
:::::

:::::{grid-item}
It may appear we are now lost in a sea of stars and constellation lines connecting some of them, but we can now explore objects on larger scales beyond the solar neighborhood.

Each exoplanet marker indicates a star with a confirmed planetary system. None of these were known before 1995, so this is a relatively new branch of astrophysics, and a burgeoning one at that. We now know of over 5,000 planets outside our Solar System, and some of these systems have multiple planets, indicated by the parenthetical number in their label (no number signifies only one known planet).

As you fly farther from the Sun, it quickly becomes clear that the constellations are only practical from our perspective in the Galaxy. Once you're a few light years out, they begin to distort. Farther still, and they only serve to visually distract, so let's turn off the constellation lines to simplify the view a little bit.

#### The Radio Sphere

{octicon}`diff-added;1.25em;profile-tour-action` {menuselection}`Scene --> Milky Way --> Graphics --> Radio Sphere`

::::::{grid} 1 2 2 2
:::::{grid-item}
[![Radio sphere with exoplanets](radio_sphere_exoplanets.png)](radio_sphere_exoplanets.png)
:::::

:::::{grid-item}
From this vantage point, turn on the Radio Sphere. The Radio Sphere is a hypothetical boundary that traces the extent of Earth's radio signals.

Earth began broadcasting to the universe around 1940. Before that, signals did not escape the atmosphere. But, in 1940, stronger signals were able to pass through the atmosphere and travel into space at one light year per year---as all light does. This results in an ever-expanding bubble we call the Radio Sphere.

At the boundary, roughly 80 light years away, are Earth's oldest
signals, like the initial broadcast of [_I Love Lucy_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Love_Lucy). As we look closer to Earth, we see more recent signals, until we arrive at Earth, where today's signals are being emitted.

We mentioned earlier that this is a hypothetical boundary because these signals lose strength as they travel out into space---as all light does. The intensity of light falls off as the radius increases---the farther you are from a candle, the dimmer it appears---and Earth's signals are no different.

In reality, by the time our radio signals reach the outer Solar System, their strength is equal to that of the cosmic noise, the background signals that randomly float throughout the Galaxy. The radio sphere remains a hypothetical boundary, but exemplifies our farthest reach into the universe, not by humans or machines, but by light we produced on Earth.

As you pull away from the Sun even farther, you can see the exoplanets in the context of the Milky Way Galaxy. While the exoplanet systems seemed evenly distributed around the Sun when we were closer to it, now we see some peculiarities. You see a cone of exoplanet systems extending away from the Sun (above the Sun in this image). This is the Kepler Mission's field of view, which we'll discuss next. 

Imagine how many planets we'd see today if Kepler was able to look at the entire sky...

#### Exoplanet Candidates

{octicon}`rocket;1.25em;profile-tour-action` Turn on the [Exoplanet Candidates](/content/milky-way/exoplanets/exoplanet-candidates/index).



::::::{grid} 1 2 2 2
:::::{grid-item}
[![Exoplanet candidate systems](exoplanet_candidates.png)](exoplanet_candidates.png)
:::::

:::::{grid-item}
Initially, we observed large planets in nearby stars---all the known planets were relatively close to the Sun. In 2009, the Kepler Telescope was launched into space. Its mission was to stare at one patch of sky near the constellation Cygnus, and find planets in that patch of sky using one [detection method](/content/milky-way/exoplanets/index). Later, in 2018, TESS was launched and is scanning the entire sky for planets.

The Exoplanet Candidates are stars, colored by mission, that are thought to be strong candidates for hosting planets. Yellow stars are from the Kepler Mission, orange stars are from the K2 Mission, and green stars are from TESS. We see the Kepler footprint clearly in the Exoplanet data---it used to be more prominent but many former candidates are now confirmed exoplanet systems and appear in that data set instead.
