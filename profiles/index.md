# Profiles

Profiles are created to customize an OpenSpace session. 

You set which assets you want to use for a presentation, set some keybindings, add some actions, and save those settings in a profile using the profile editor. Upon launching OpenSpace with a profile selected, those data and settings will be loaded for your presentation.

:::::{grid} 1 1 1 2

::::{grid-item} 
Each of these pages is designed to offer a guided narrative with screen shots---the storytelling that drove the creation of the profile---links to the included data sets in [Content](/content/index), keyboard shortcuts, and actions included in the profile.

We list the Default profile first because it provides a basis for many other profiles. It includes all the basics and is often used for a _Grand Tour_ of the Universe. The remaining are listed alphabetically.

::::{grid-item} 
:::{important}
We use the following symbols in profile pages to indicate actions:

{.no-bullet}
- {octicon}`rocket;1.25em;profile-tour-action` : Flight instructions
- {octicon}`diff-added;1.25em;profile-tour-action` : Turn on a data set
- {octicon}`diff-removed;1.25em;profile-tour-action` : Turn off a data set
- {octicon}`tools;1.25em;profile-tour-action`: Adjust a setting for a data set
- {octicon}`telescope;1.25em;profile-tour-action` :  Target an object
- {octicon}`stopwatch;1.25em;profile-tour-action` : Change the time settings
% {octicon}`globe`: 
% {octicon}`info`: 
% {octicon}`play`: 
% {octicon}`question`: 
% {octicon}`smiley`: 
% {octicon}`milestone`:
% {octicon}`location`:

:::{note}
We will discuss profile authoring in a forthcoming page. For the time being, a [syntax page](/creating-data-assets/profiles) exists for those who are comfortable with behind the scenes coding.
