# Profiles

Profiles collect the assets you want to use for a presentation and, upon launching OpenSpace with a profile selected, loads those assets and settings appropriate for your presentation.

We list the Default profile first because it provides a basis for many other profiles. It includes all the basics and is often used for a _Grand Tour_ of the Universe. The remaining are listed alphabetically.

Each of these pages is designed to offer a narrative---the storytelling that drove the creation of the profile---links to the included data sets in [Content](/content/index), and screenshots at critical steps in the story.


:::{note}
We will discuss profile authoring in a forthcoming page. For the time being, a [syntax page](/creating-data-assets/profiles) exists for those who are comfortable with behind the scenes coding.
