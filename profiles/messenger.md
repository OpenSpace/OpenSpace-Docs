# Messenger
This profile contains a model and trajectory of the NASA MESSENGER spacecraft with craft pointing data from March to June 2011. In addition, a rendering of Mercury's magnetosphere based on data recorded by MESSENGER can be enabled and viewed around the planet. Along with the mission data, additional maps were added to Mercury showing element abundances on the surface and a multi-color mosaic from the Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS) instrument.
