# Mission Profiles



:::::{grid} 1 1 1 2

::::{grid-item} 
Mission profiles are designed to unfurl the entire mission in realtime. We have comprehensive data about each mission, including the position and attitude of the spacecraft, and can essentially follow along in realtime. Of course, we may not want to watch the JWST unfold for over ten minutes, so we can speed time up as well.

Mission profiles are accompanied by the Mission Panel which displays an interactive timeline and lists the mission milestones that you can click on for more information and to see the conditions of the spacecraft at that milestone.

We use the following symbols in profile pages to indicate actions:

{.no-bullet}
- {octicon}`rocket;1.25em;profile-tour-action` : Flight instructions
- {octicon}`diff-added;1.25em;profile-tour-action` : Turn on a data set
- {octicon}`diff-removed;1.25em;profile-tour-action` : Turn off a data set
- {octicon}`tools;1.25em;profile-tour-action`: Adjust a setting for a data set
- {octicon}`telescope;1.25em;profile-tour-action` :  Target an object
- {octicon}`stopwatch;1.25em;profile-tour-action` : Change the time settings
