# Space Weather Profiles

"There are three publicly available profiles dedicated to showing space weather phenomena. They are all made by the collaborators at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. The data used for these are mainly either observation data or simulation outputs from different simulation models."
