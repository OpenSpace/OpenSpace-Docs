# Bastille Day 2000

This profile shows the Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) that occurred on Bastille Day, July 14, 2000. The profile is data heavy and will require a powerful graphics card (GPU).

## Tour

Since this profile include a lot of different visuals. To avoid cluttering the scene it is recommended to use the provided keyboard shortcuts to toggle different parts on and off.

This CME event might be the most studied solar storm so far. The visualizations to highlight the CME include;

* a volume rendering of the density of the material ejected from the Sun,<br>
* field lines showing the Sun's magnetic structure,<br>
* magnetograms which are texture layers on the Sun showing variation in strength of the magnetic field,<br>
* an extreme ultra violet (EUV) image sequence layer shown on the Sun,<br>
* a light speed indicator to compare the speed of the CME,<br>
* cut-plane sequences showing the proton intensity (flux values) of the CME, one equatorial cut plane and one meridional,<br>
* flux nodes that also show the proton intensity (flux values), which are accompanied by a legend describing the color scheme. Flux nodes are simulated points positioned along the magnetic fields where the flux values are calculated

## Data Sets

The data for this profile is provided by Predictive Science Inc. (PSI) and are the results of simulations. The two models used from them are the MAS / CORHEL model for the corona visualizations and EPREM for the flux visualizations. At PSI they call the flux nodes, "Stream nodes".
