# Bastille Day 2000

This profile shows the Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) that occurred on Bastille Day, July 14, 2000. The profile is data heavy and will require a powerful graphics card (GPU).

## Tour

This profile includes many different visuals, so to avoid cluttering the scene, it is recommended to use the provided keyboard shortcuts to toggle elements on and off.

This CME event might be the most studied solar storm so far. The visualizations to highlight the CME include:

- A volume rendering of the density of the material ejected from the Sun
- Field lines showing the Sun's magnetic structure
- Magnetograms which are texture layers on the Sun showing variation in strength of the magnetic field,
- An extreme ultra-violet (EUV) image sequence layer shown on the Sun
- A speed of light indicator to compare the speed of the CME
- Cut-plane sequences showing the proton intensity (flux values) of the CME, one equatorial cut plane and one meridiona,
- Flux nodes that also show the proton intensity (flux values), which are accompanied by a legend describing the color scheme. Flux nodes are simulated points positioned along the magnetic fields where the flux values are calculated

## Data Sets

The visualizations of the solar corona in this profile are provided by Predictive Science Inc. (PSI) simulation model [MAS/CORHEL](https://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/models/CORHEL~MAS-TDM~6.0) for the corona visualizations. The [EPREM](https://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/models/EPREM~0/) model is used for the flux visualizations. The EPREM model was developed by the Young-Schwadron modeling group at the University of New Hampshire.
