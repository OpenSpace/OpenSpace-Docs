# Git Branch Naming Conventions
  - `feature/X` if X is a big project that covers multiple issues
  - `integration/X` if X is a branch off a non-master branch and the original branch has been merged into master already, but there are still some differences needed for some reason
  - `issue/X-Y` if X is a GitHub issue; X is the GitHub issue number and Y is a short descriptive word or two
  - `project/X` if X is a thing that branched off from master and is not expected to be merged back. We are trying to keep these to an absolute minimum
  - `thesis/year/X` thesis student projects
