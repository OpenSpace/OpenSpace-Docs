## New features
### SkyBrowser

## User interface improvements
  - Added a new panel to create SGCT configuration files
  - Added a panel showing the keyboard and all actions that are bound to keys
  - Added links to tutorial pages in the menu
  - Added the ability for users to reorder planetary layers


## Bug fixes
