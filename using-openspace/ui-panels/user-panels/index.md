## Panel Overview

The User Panels button provides shortcuts to user-created web panels, which are html pages using the OpenSpace javascript API. The "Open Local panels" section needs html pages to be saved as `index.html` inside individual folders created inside the `user/webpanels` folder. The "Open from URL" section allows you to create shortcuts to html pages served from elsewhere. The [HTML Controls Setup Guide](/creating-data-assets/custom-web-ui/html-controls-setup/) explains the process of creating such html control pages.
