# Tour Panel

![Tour Panel Button](/using-openspace/toolbar/tour-panel/toolbar_button_tour.png)

The Tour Panel displays an interactive, getting started tour of OpenSpace. The panel will guide you through exercises while you interact with OpenSpace. The tour will give you an introduction to navigating in OpenSpace, how to manipulate time, and alter scenes (the look of objects and data).

Throughout the tour, you will have tasks to complete. These tasks are designed to take you through some of the fundamental ways in which you interact with OpenSpace. Once you've achieved a task, you will see the green check box appear.

For example, in the navigation section of the tour, it asks you to fly closer to Earth. It gives you instructions on how to do so, and once you are below the requested altitude, 3,500 km, the task will be completed.

As the tour progresses, it will ask you to use what you've learned with fewer hints. Here we have a trio of tasks using the knowledge gained from earlier tasks.

The final section of the tour takes you through some tasks that use the [Scene Panel](/using-openspace/toolbar/scene/index) to manipulate the look of the scene.
