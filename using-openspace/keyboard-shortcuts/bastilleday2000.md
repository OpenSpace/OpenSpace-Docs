To better show the CME event a few different time loops have been implemented with different start and end times and differences in how fast time is sped up:

:::{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:stub-columns: 1
* - Shortcut
  - Function
* - {kbd}`CTRL+1`
  - For a short loop. 10:03 - 10:16, at 2 min/ second. Recommended for close-up view of the Sun
* - {kbd}`CTRL+2`
  - For the "standard" loop. 10:03 - 11:00, at 4 min/ second. A generally good loop showing most of the event at a good pace
* - {kbd}`CTRL+3`
  - For a fast loop. 10:03 - 11.48, at 15 min/ second. In case something particular will be showcased over and over
* - {kbd}`CTRL+4`
  - For a long loop. 09:30 - 13:00, at 4 min/ second. Starting earlier and ends even after some of the data sets no longer have data at those time steps
* - {kbd}`r`
  - To cancel looping and reset the time to 10.03
