# Customizing Profiles
[Profiles](/getting-started/profiles/index) help us to 
1. set properties to initial values when we start up OpenSpace
2. load the assets we desire to display
3. set keybindings for various actions
4. set initial camera location and orientation
and more advanced uses like additional modules and additional scripts. Though we can [create profiles by hand](/content/profiles), the recommended way and the easier way would be to use the profile editor which is accessed via the "Edit" or "New" buttons under the 'Choose Profile' section of the Launcher window when starting up OpenSpace.

Let's take the example of the dwarf planet Haumea for customizing a profile. The default profile does not include this dwarf planet (though the default_full profile does), so let's edit the default profile to add Haumea. With the default profile selected, click "Edit" under the 'Choose Profile' section of the Launcher window. Now choose the "Edit" button next to Assets in the Profile Editor window.

The asset selector window which opens up lists all the assets available under data/assets of the current installation. Since we know we're looking for Haumea, we can directly type it into the search box and find it immediately instead of having to navigate through all the folders, and enable it with the checkbox on the right, as below.

After clicking "Save", we can save this profile as default_with_Haumea by typing that name in the Profile Name box and then "Save" at the bottom of the Profile Editor window.
