## What Is an Action?

Actions are set of instructions that can automatically alter one or more properties in OpenSpace's Scene Panel. These can be used to make a planet larger, turn off object trails, or change the Simulation Speed or time. There is no editor, per se, to create actions---currently they are only available via asset files and coding the proper openSpace commands.

The idea with an action is to automate one or many alterations that you would otherwise have to find in the Scene Panel and enact via checking something on and off, or adjusting a slider. With one button, you can accomplish many adjustments to many datasets to craft a scene to your liking.
