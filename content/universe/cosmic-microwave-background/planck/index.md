In 2009, the European Space Agency launched the Planck satellite
into space. Its first all-sky map of the CMB was released in
2013 and greatly improved upon WMAPâ€™s results. The mission was
named after Max Planck, who derived the equation for a blackbody
(an object that absorbs light completely).
Planck observed the sky in nine wavelengths to better constrain the
foreground light (WMAP observed in five wavelengths). The resulting
map is more precise than WMAP and will be more accurate in
subtracting the foreground light.
The orange areas represent the slightly hotter areas, and the blue
areas show the areas that are slightly cooler.
