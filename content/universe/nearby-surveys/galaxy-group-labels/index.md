# Galaxy Group Labels

{menuselection}`Universe --> Nearby Surveys --> Galaxy Group Labels`


As we outlined in [Local Group](../local-group/index), a galaxy group is a small number of galaxies gravitationally interacting with one another. Often, it consists of a one or a few large galaxies like the Milky Way and a cadre of small, satellite galaxies that orbit them.

The Galaxy Groups Labels is a set of labels that identifies the nearby groups in the Tully Galaxies.

The Galaxy Group Labels data are designed to be shown with the Tully galaxies.

While the Local Group is fairly fleshed out---we see many of the dwarf galaxies orbiting our galaxy and those around the Andromeda Galaxy---the surrounding groups are less well known. They are so far away that we cannot see the small dwarf galaxies within them. So, most of these galaxy groups have only a one, two or a few galaxies to them. These will be the largest galaxies in those groups, just as the Milky Way and Andromeda are the largest in the Local Group.

Some of the closest groups include the M81 Group, the Sculptor Group, the Cen A Group, and the NGC 2403 Group. Each of these contain one or more large galaxies. Historically, the term *cloud* was used to describe groups of groups, but this term has fallen from favor given it's physically ambiguous.
