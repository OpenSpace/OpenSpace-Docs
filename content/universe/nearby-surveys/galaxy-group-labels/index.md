## Overview

As we outlined in [Local Group](../local-group/index), a galaxy group is a small number of galaxies gravitationally interacting with one another. Often, it consists of a one or a few large galaxies, like the Milky Way, and a cadre of small, satellite galaxies that orbit them.

The Galaxy Groups Labels is a set of labels that identifies the nearby groups in the Tully Galaxies.

The nearby galaxy groups around the Milky Way, which lies at the center of the grid. Our home galaxy group is called the Local Group, seen labeled here.

:::{note}
The Galaxy Group Labels are designed to be shown with the [Tully Galaxies](../tully-galaxies/index).

While the Local Group is fairly fleshed out---we see many dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way and Andromeda Galaxies---the surrounding groups are less detailed. They are so far away that we cannot see the small dwarf galaxies within them. So, most of these galaxy groups have only one, two, or a few galaxies as members. These will be the largest galaxies in those groups, just as the Milky Way and Andromeda are the largest in the Local Group.

Some of the closest groups include the [M81 Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M81_Group), the [Sculptor Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sculptor_Group), the [Cen A/M83 Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaurus_A/M83_Group), and the [NGC 2403 Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_2403). Each of these contain one or more large galaxies. Historically, the term *cloud* was used to describe groups of groups, but this term has fallen from favor given it's physically ambiguous.
