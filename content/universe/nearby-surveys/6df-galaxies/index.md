# 6dF Galaxies

{menuselection}`Universe --> Nearby Surveys --> 6dF Galaxies`


The Six-degree Field (6dF) Galaxy Survey mapped roughly half the sky from the Anglo-Australian Observatory. The survey used the 1.2-meter UK Schmidt Telescope at Siding Spring Observatory in New South Wales, Australia, and allowed for a six degree field of view per observation.

The 6dF galaxies resemble those of Tully, in scale and in color. We use the same color map for all galaxy surveys, where galaxies in more dense areas appear orange and yellow, and galaxies in less dense areas are green and aqua. The large-scale structure is clearly visible here, but not as consolidated as it is in the Tully galaxies.

This catalog overlaps with the Tully dataset, and there is a noticeable
difference in the quality of these datasets. Tully is much tighter
and the structure is more apparent, while the 6dF data are more
spread out. This is because of local motions within galaxy clusters
have not been corrected in these data.
Fingers of God. Early in the process of mapping the local universe,
astronomers noticed that galaxies, when plotted, appeared
on lines that pointed radially back to Earth. It turns out, these lines,
dubbed “fingers of god,” are a cluster of galaxies spread out radially
(along the line of sight) because of the local motions within the
cluster result in a “smearing” of the redshift, which we use to compute
the distance. For example, the galaxies of the Local Group are
all moving in seemingly random directions as they gravitationally
interact with one another—many are blueshifted (coming toward
us) even as the universe expands. These local motions within clusters
contaminate the overall redshift in the spectrum, causing the
distances to be less accurate, which appears to stretch these clusters
along our line of sight.
Completeness. Unlike the Tully galaxies, these data show an
incompleteness in the sample. Most of the rich structure is visible
closer to the Milky Way, where we see more of the dimmer
galaxies. Toward the edge of the data set we see galaxies by their
lonesome. This is because these data are not as complete. We’re
only seeing the brighter galaxies to this distance, and therefore less
complex structures are visible.




Unlike other nearby galaxy catalogues, this one is not all-sky, meaning there are patches of sky that are not covered. In this case, the entire northern hemisphere has no
coverage at all.
