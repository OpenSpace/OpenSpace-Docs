# Universe

{menuselection}`Universe`


*Universe* includes everything outside the Milky Way Galaxy.

These data sets are more homogeneous, consisting mostly of galaxy surveys. We also display the microwave all-sky images here, and a few other contextual data sets.

Unlike the Milky Way that is organized by object type, here we divide the data by local surveys, deep sky surveys, and the cosmic microwave background all-sky maps.

The Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The red points are quasars and the blue and green points are the galaxy survey. These are among the deepest surveys of the universe we have observed, and quasars are the farthest objects we see. The Milky Way Galaxy is located at the center of the image where these data appear to converge. This convergence is an observational bias based on the fact that we observe all of these data from Earth---our only observatory in the universe. The conspicuous absence of data on either side in the centerline of the image are due to observational limitations of the survey.
