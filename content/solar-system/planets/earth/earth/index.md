% On average, Earth is 149 million kilometers (93 million miles) from the Sun, with its closest approach (147 million km or 91.4 million miles) in early January and its farthest distance from the Sun in July (152 million km, or 94.5 million miles). While the planets' orbits look circular, they are actually ellipses that, in most cases, are close to circular.
