Solar Glare is the default representation of the Sun. It is a diffuse image placed on the Sun that represents a bright star. It is the same image we use for other stars.

The glare is designed to emulate how we actually see stars given the limitation of our eyes. We do not see a "ball" in the sky (unless Earth's cloud cover filtering the sunlight is just right), we see a bright, diffuse light.

This rendition allows us to see the Sun to great distances, and reminds us that the Sun is the biggest, brightest object in our tiny corner of the universe.
