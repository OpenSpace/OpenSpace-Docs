# Solar Surface

{menuselection}`Scene --> Solar System --> Solar Surface`



:::{warning}
This section is incomplete---nothing to see here, yet.
:::


The Solar Surface is a representation of the Sun's photosphere. The photosphere is the layer of the sun directly below its transparent atmosphere. Although the Sun is a ball of gas and hot plasma, it appears to have a surface. In reality, this is the last layer of opaqueness, called the photosphere, that sits below a transparent atmosphere of sorts.

This rendition is properly sized for the radius of the Sun, which is 695,700 kilometers (432,288 miles). About 218 Earths would fit across the diameter of the Sun.
