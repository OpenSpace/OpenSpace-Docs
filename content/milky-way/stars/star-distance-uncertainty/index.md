:alt: Among a starfield, from a perspective about 1,500 light years from earth, we see lines on select stars that represent their uncertainty range in distance. 

Lines that represent the range of distance uncertainty for a selection of stars. From this vantage point, 1,500 light years from Earth, these lines radially point back to the Earth, so it appears to form a vortex from this perspective. A few of the foreground stars are labeled with their star name and the length of distance uncertainty in light years. Aqua lines represent stars with Gaia geometric parallax distances, orange lines denote Gaia photogeometric parallax distances, and yellow lines represent uncertainties for Hipparcos distances.

## Uncertainty?

Every object that we measure has some uncertainty associated with that measurement. For the stars, we measure something called the parallax. As Earth traverses around the each year,

The position of each object in the Digital Universe has an uncertainty
associated with it. To illustrate this, we demonstrate distance
uncertainty for several stars of various distances and luminosities.
From Earth, we can measure a star’s two-dimensional position in the
sky to great accuracy. However, the star’s distance remains elusive.
Our most accurate distances come from the measurement of an
angle in the sky that is imperceptible to the naked eye. This angle
results from the trigonometric parallax (the apparent motion of the
star resulting from the Earth’s motion around the Sun), and the uncertainties
and errors in the measurement of this angle translate into
uncertainties in the star’s distance.
Representing uncertainty. In the atlas, uncertainties are represented
by a series of points that, when viewed from a distance, appear
to form a line. The points are spaced 1 light year apart, and we
leave a space for the published parallax distance. Labels, in light
years, denote the near distance uncertainty, the published distance,
and the far distance uncertainty.
The star Bellatrix in Orion one of the closer star in this sample. At
252 light years, it has a mere 20-light-year uncertainty. Compare
that with Betelgeuse, a star that is nearby in the sky but lies about
250 light years beyond the Bellatrix. Rigel, also in Orion, is about
twice the distance of Betelgeuse and has a larger uncertainty. As
you explore the atlas of stars, nebulae, and galaxies, consider that
there is uncertainty associated with each of these objects and often
the uncertainty for nonstellar objects is far greater.
