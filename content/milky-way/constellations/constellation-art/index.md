# Constellation Art

{menuselection}`Scene --> Milky Way --> Constellations --> Constellation Art`


Constellations have been part of the human experience since prehistoric times. We looked to the sky as these visual bookmarks reminded us of the popular stories and lore of our culture. And, of course, many different cultures devised their own constellations independently of one another. 

As language and the printed word became more common, illustrated star catalogs were published. Many examples of such illustrations exist, but Johann Bayer's, 17th-century *[Uranometria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranometria)* was one of the most complete and the first to depict the stars from Earth's view, rather than from outside the celestial sphere, as was traditional up to that point.

Bayer was also the first to assign designations to the stars. Names for the brightest stars existed since antiquity, but he cataloged the stars giving them Greek names, Alpha for the brightest star in the constellation, Beta for the second brightest, and so on.

A page showing the constellation Orion from Johann Bayer's _Uranometria_ from 1661. The stars are rendered according to brightness (larger is brighter), and have small Greek letters beside them assigned by Bayer. Overlaid is the rendition of Orion, drawn with his sword, shield, and club.

## Artwork updated

The art appearing here was drawn by [James Hedberg](http://jameshedberg.com) from the City College of New York. He has updated the art from traditional depictions to something more modern.

## Using in OpenSpace

### Scene Menu

{menuselection}`Scene --> Milky Way --> Constellations --> Constellation Art`

From the scene menu, each constellation is accessible for you to turn on and off individually. Use this option if you just want to show one or a limited number of constellations.


### Keyboard shortcut

`c`, `Shift-c`

Use the `c` key to turn on all constellation figures. There may be a slight delay while they load, but this will bring up the artwork for all 88 constellations. Use `Shift-c` to turn them off.


### Actions panel

{menuselection}`Actions --> Constellations --> Art`

The Actions Panel has several convenient items to control the constellations. The `Hide all`/`Show All` toggles the artwork on and off for all 88 constellations. `Disable all` removes the asset from the scene (and out of memory).

Use `Show zodiac` and `Hide zodiac` buttons turn only the zodiacal constellations on and off.

The Constellations Art action menu. Here you can turn on each constellation's artwork with the `Show all` button. You can turn them all off with the `Disable all` button. You can show and hide all the zodiacal constellations. And, the `Hide all` button keeps the artwork loaded but unseen.
