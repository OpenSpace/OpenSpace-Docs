# Constellation Art

{menuselection}`Milky Way --> Constellations --> Constellation Art`


Constellations have been part of the human experience since prehistoric times. We looked to the sky as bookmarks, in a sense, of the popular stories and lore of our culture. And, of course, many different cultures devised their own constellations independently of one another. 

As language and the printed word became more common, illustrated star catalogs were published. Many examples of such illustrations exist, but Johann Bayer's, 17th-century *[Uranometria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranometria)* was one of the most complete and the first to depict the stars from Earth's view, rather than from outside the celestial sphere, the tradition up to that point.

Bayer was also the first to assign designations to the stars. Names for the brightest stars existed since antiquity, but he cataloged the stars giving them Greek names, Alpha for the brightest star in the constellation, Beta for the second brightest, and so on.

A page showing the constellation Orion from Johann Bayer's *Uranometria* from 1661. The stars are rendered according to brightness (larger is brighter), and have small Greek letters beside them assigned by Bayer. Overlaid is the rendition of Orion, drawn with his sword, shield, and club.

## Artwork updated

The art appearing here was drawn by [James Hedberg](http://jameshedberg.com) from the City College of New York. He has updated the art from traditional depictions to something more modern.

Constellation art overlay the constellation lines. Here we see Orion, the hunter; Taurus, the bull; Canis Minor, the little dog; and the head of Canis Major, the big dog, at the bottom of the frame.

## Using in OpenSpace

There are two access points for the constellation art. One is the Scene Menu, in {menuselection}`Scene --> Milky Way --> Constellations --> Constellation Art`, but access is limited here to each individual constellation. If you want to turn an individual constellation's artwork on, then use the Scene Menu to access that asset. 

More often, we want to see all the constellation art at once---to see the entire night sky's constellations as figures, not lines. To achieve this, use the Action Menu {menuselection}`Actions --> Constellations --> Art`.

The Constellations Art action menu. Here you can turn on each constellation's artwork with the `Show all` button. You can turn them all off with the `Disable all` button. You can show and hide all the zodiacal constellations. And, the `Hide all` button keeps the artwork loaded but unseen.
