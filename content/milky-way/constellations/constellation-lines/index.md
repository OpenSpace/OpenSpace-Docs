# Constellation Lines

{menuselection}`Milky Way --> Constellations --> Constellation Lines`


Constellation lines trace out the imaginary star patterns in the night sky. These lines are traditionally how we view the constellations---they guide the eye without being too visually intrusive.

Constellations have a long [history](../index), but by the early 20th century, astronomers had designated eighty-eight constellations that covered the entire night sky, northern and southern hemisphere. Many of these derived from the ancient Greek constellations.

## A unique perspective

As mentioned on the [top constellation page](../index), the constellations are only relevant from our point of view. Because the stars are so far away, we can fly beyond the orbit of Neptune and they will still look the same. However, beyond the Solar System the figures breakdown.

While the lines connect stars at their accurate distance, the labels for the constellations are placed arbitrarily at a constant distance. If you fly away from Earth you'll soon see the labels all huddled around the Sun at the same distance.

Each of these constellations have patterns that are recognized outside of its constellation. Astronomers call these *asterisms*. In Ursa Major we have the widely recognized (to northern hemisphere observers) Big Dipper while Ursa Minor is also known as the Little Dipper. Ursa Minor also contains the "pole star," Polaris, which is often thought to be the brightest star in the sky, but, in fact, it is only the 48th brightest star. Polaris is special because it's always in the same spot in the sky.

## Beyond the Solar System

As we fly away from the Solar System, the constellation figures distort; however, the lines may be used as a visual aid in other ways. As mentioned earlier, as we pull into the stars around the Sun, the lines cue us to the distance of these objects, providing a good perspective on the solar neighborhood. 

Additionally, the constellation lines may be used a signpost that points back to Earth from outside the Milky Way Galaxy. With the lines on as one roams around the outside of the Galaxy, we can see where the Solar System lies within the Galaxy, and we see the miniscule extent to which the stars that make up the constellations occupy the Milky Way Galaxy.

Showing the constellation lines from this perspective offers us a "you are here" signpost---the Sun and accompanying planets lie at the center of the area pointed to by the lines. Furthermore, we can see the small extent to which the naked-eye stars of the constellations inhabit the Galaxy.
