# Galaxy

The Galaxy section is where we place all our three-dimensional renditions of the Milky Way. In the atlas of the universe, this is the only area that is not based solely from observational data.

Because we live inside the Milky Way, it's difficult for us to truly understand the structure of our Galaxy, and impossible for us to have a picture of it from the outside. For our rendition of the Galaxy, we must make the the most scientifically informed  judgments we can and build a 3-D model that reflects the latest in our understanding of the Milky Way.

These data sets fill that role, providing a model for the Milky Way that we can examine from outside the Galaxy, and provide context to the data sets within it.
