# Milky Way Galaxy Image

{menuselection}`Scene --> Milky Way --> Galaxy --> Milky Way Galaxy Image`


The Milky Way Image provides a basis, albeit representational and two-dimensional, of galactic structure that's typical of the Milky Way. It is an image of the galaxy [NGC 1232](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_1232) in the constellation Eridanus as seen from Earth.

The Galaxy Image---NGC 1232---as seen in OpenSpace. This view, from above the Galaxy, demonstrates the resemblance to what we believe the Milky Way Galaxy look like. We see a bright center with a slight bar structure, prominent spiral arms, bright star-forming regions sprinkled throughout the arms, and gas and dust filling out the disk.

We chose this galaxy because it resembles the overall structure of the Milky Way---a spiral galaxy with a bar---and it is oriented face-on from our vantage point on Earth. While NGC 1232 is not precisely a twin of the Milky Way, which is believed to have a more pronounced bar, it is a good stand in for its bar, spiral structure, and the bright star-forming regions ([HII regions](../../nebulae/HII-regions/index)) that dot the arms. It is properly sized and oriented, and all the data sets inside and peripheral to the Galaxy may be viewed within this scaled context.

## Image modifications

To prepare this image, some alterations were necessary. We "painted out" some areas, in particular an area where it's believed a companion galaxy was interacting with one of the outer spiral arms. Some work was also done on enhancing the image to highlight structure.
