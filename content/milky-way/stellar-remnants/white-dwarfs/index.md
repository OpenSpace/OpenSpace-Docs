# White Dwarfs

{menuselection}`Milky Way --> Stellar Remnants --> White Dwarfs`


A white dwarf is compact remnant---the final evolutionary state of over 97% of the stars in the Milky Way. This fate is determined by the mass of the star. Stars less massive than the range have long lifetimes on the order of trillions of years. Stars more massive than the range will result in either a neutron star or black hole. Stars within the range, from about 0.08 to 8 solar masses, become a red giant, shed their layers in a planetary nebula, revealing a compact core called a white dwarf.


## Extraordinarily dense

The mass is a white dwarf is on the order of the Sun's mass, but its size is similar to Earth's. So, they are extremely dense objects---one billion kilograms per cubic meter. Astronomers call the material that makes up a white dwarf *degenerate* matter. Inside a normal star, gravitational forces pulling inward are balanced by the internal pressure produced from the release of energy. However, inside a white dwarf, there is no internal pressure to counter gravity, so the object is further compacted by the force of gravity until the electrons of neighboring atoms are smashed up against one another. The object cannot collapse further because, atomically, the electrons have nowhere to go.


## Ultimate fate

Over time, white dwarfs cool slowly and eventually fade from view. The Sun will meet this fate, transitioning into a red giant in about six billion years, the star will expand to envelope Earth in about 7.6 billion years. Within about 200 million years after that, the Sun will shed its outer layers into a planetary nebula, and a white dwarf will emerge.


## Representing white dwarfs

White dwarfs are too dim to see with the unaided eye. The first one, called 40 Eridani B, was discovered was by the famous astronomer William Herschel (1738--1822) in 1783. The second one was discovered in 1862 as a companion to the star Sirius.

Because these are dim objects, we exaggerate their appearance here by representing them with points far brighter than their actual brightness. This allows us to see where they are in the sky, and how they're distributed around the Sun.
