# Exoplanets

Extrasolar planets, or exoplanets, are a relatively new phenomenon in astronomy. While many astronomers believed in their existence, no observational evidence was available until 1995. Since that time, scientists have discovered thousands of systems consisting of one or more planets around a host star.

Decades after their discovery, more sophisticated missions are discovering the locations and characteristics of these systems which we visualize with these data sets.

:alt: Blue rings mark the locations of exoplanetary systems. We are looking back toward the Sun from hundreds of light years away, and the green, wire-frame sphere, centered on the Sun, shows the extent of our radio signals. The sphere is 160 light years in diameter.

Blue rings mark stars that have a known planetary system. The 80-light-year-radius, wire-frame sphere is called the Radio Sphere and encompasses our radio signals, which have been traveling out into space for roughly 80 years. The Sun and Solar System lie at the center of the sphere. Many exoplanets lie inside the sphere and, theoretically, have heard from us.
