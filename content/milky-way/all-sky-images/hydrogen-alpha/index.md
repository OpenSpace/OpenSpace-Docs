# Hydrogen-alpha All-sky Image

{menuselection}`Milky Way --> All-sky Images --> Hydrogen-alpha`


Hydrogen-alpha, or Hα, is a term that describes light from the ground state of the hydrogen atom. When an electron in an atom moves from one energy level to a higher one, we say the atom is excited. But the electron does not move to this higher energy level without the atom absorbing energy from either another atom or a passing photon (packet of light).

Once the atom is excited, it cannot remain in that state for long before it wants to return to its ground state. When the electron moves back down to the lower energy level, light is released at a wavelength commensurate with the energy between the two levels. For the Hα line, this energy difference translates to a wavelength of 656 nanometers in the extreme red end of the visible spectrum.

This survey of the sky is a snapshot of light from this wavelength.
We can see this light with our eyes, but it is lost within the integrated
light from the entire visible spectrum.
Image features. One distinctive element of the sky at this wavelength
is the presence of large, spherical bubbles surrounding hot
stars. Two prominent examples are Lambda Orionis and Zeta Ophiuchi;
each are extremely hot stars that excite the surrounding hydrogen
gas, causing it to glow.
Many nebulae and star-forming regions are visible, including the
California Nebula, and what could be called the Orion nebluplex.
Among the sights in the lower part of Orion, the Great Nebula
of Orion is among the most beautiful star-forming regions in our
neighborhood. Just above it is the Horsehead Nebula, an emission
nebula with a small, obscuring dust cloud in the shape of a horse’s
head. Surrounding this is the extended supernova remnant called
Barnard’s Loop.
We also see that galaxies emit H-a light, including the Andromeda
Galaxy and the faint M33, the large face-on spiral in Triangulum. In
the southern sky are the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC
and SMC), two nearby satellite galaxies that are interacting with the
Milky Way.
