The Milky Way as seen by our eyes---in visible light. Looking toward the constellations Scorpius and Sagittarius, the Milky Way is very prominent. This is because we're looking toward the center of the Galaxy, so there is more "stuff" in that direction.

In ancient times, our ancestors observed the stars, the wandering stars---planets, and the Milky Way. Aside from the occasional comet, guest star (or supernova), or aurora, these were the only cosmic attractions visible to them.

The Milky Way has been the subject of many myths and legends. The Greeks believed it to be a river of milk pouring from the breast of Hera, the wife of Zeus, and called it a "galaxy," from the Greek word for milk. The Romans called it the Via Lactea, or the Milky Way. But it was not until 1610 that Galileo first observed this faint band of light with his telescope, discovering that it was composed of innumerable faint stars.

In the past 400 years, astronomers and philosophers have specu- lated about the nature of this band of light, but it was not until the 20th century that astronomers began to understand the nature and structure of our Galaxy.
You will see the brightest part of the Galaxy if you look toward Galactic center in the constellations Scorpius and Sagittarius [or, turn on the Galactic coordinates and bring (l, b) = (0, 0)Â° to center screen]. This bright haze is the light from millions of stars; the dark lanes are foreground dust clouds, obscuring our view of the stars behind them.
If you turn to look in the opposite direction, toward Orion, you will see that the Milky Way is not too bright on this side of the sky. Here we look out of the Galaxy through what remains of the Galactic disk between the Sun and its outer edge.
This image, by Axel Mellinger, is composed of many photographs of the sky, carefully knitted together in this giant mosaic. The stars have been removed for the most part, but the bright stars show some residual light.
