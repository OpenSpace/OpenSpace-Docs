Download version 0.19.2 on the OpenSpace website [installation page](https://openspaceproject.com/version-0192). Below are notes that highlight new content and bug fixes that will be relevant for OpenSpace users.

## Content
  - Europa's Default View: As you approach Jupiter's moon Europa in the software, you'll now see a more detailed image. This is the new standard view.
  - Custom Effects for Galaxies: For those who enjoy personalizing visuals, you can now tweak how the galaxy appears in the software.

## Bug Fixes
  - Vanishing Globe Tiles: Some users reported that parts of globe surfaces would sometimes disappear. We've made a temporary fix to address this by disabling a feature. We're working on a permanent solution, but for now, you shouldn't see any missing tiles.
  - Shadow Naming Corrected: We've sorted out a naming confusion. The terms 'umbral' and 'penumbral' for shadows were mixed up in places â€“ that's been set right now.
