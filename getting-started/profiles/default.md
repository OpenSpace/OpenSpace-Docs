This profile is enabled on default and provides the ability to look at detailed terrain models of the Earth, Moon, Mars, other planets, and the Digital Universe extrasolar catalog.

The view defaults on Earth at the current time with the ESRI VIIRS Combo enabled. This uses the Suomi VIIRS daily images when viewing the whole Earth, and switches to high-detail imagery from ESRI when zooming in.
