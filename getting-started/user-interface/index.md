# User Interface




## Interface
When you first launch _OpenSpace_, you will be focused on Earth at the yesterdays date. In the top left corner of your window is your **Dashboard.**. By default, this displays:
 - Distance to the _Focus_ in kilometers
 - Avg. FPS: Average frames per second
 - Position: Latitude and longitude position and altitude of the camera relative to the _Focus_ object

You can modify this information (including the display font and size) in {menuselection}`Settings --> Dashboard`.

In the top right corner of your window are **Friction Toggles**, see the [next](/getting-started/navigation) part of the getting started guide about these controls.

In the bottom right corner of your window is **Version Information**, which is the current build and version number of _OpenSpace_ you are using.

Along the bottom row are your **Menus** (also known as Graphical User Interface, or GUI). These menus, from left to right, are:
 - System
 - Scene
 - Settings
 - Navigation
 - Time
 - Session Recording
 - Slides

You can toggle the visibility of the text information using {kbd}`Shift+TAB` and toggle the visibility of the menu with {kbd}`TAB`.
